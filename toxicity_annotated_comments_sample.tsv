26547.0	`This is such a fun entry.   DevotchkaNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -)NEWLINE_TOKEN:Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJKNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENVietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - JuuitchanNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSomeone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``. LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI deleted the following pair: ``limited (Ltd)`` and ``incorporated``, since they actually mean different things. ``Incorporated`` means a corporation; ``limited`` means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJKNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, I'd call it a ``torch``, and it would probably be labeled as a ``flashlight`` in its manufacturer's packaging.

As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  WesleyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Old Interpreted Language article ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, becauseNEWLINE_TOKENmost languages can be implemented in either way, and some languagesNEWLINE_TOKEN(like Perl) are compiled atNEWLINE_TOKENruntime but behave as if they were interpreted.NEWLINE_TOKENOther languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into anNEWLINE_TOKENintermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).NEWLINE_TOKENSome languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs Java interpreted, or what? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java programming language article says:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code.

Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins.

Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty .

207166.0	`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:NEWLINE_TOKEN: * Nothing ``compels`` a just God to ``enforce`` a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means a better translation would be ``whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself``. Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a ``river of fire``.

To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.NEWLINE_TOKEN: * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah.

207582.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::: On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)	2002	True	article	random	dev

Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists  racist and anti-racist  have not been persecuted the way Galileo was.  Perhaps racist scientists should be.  But even here I would qualify it  not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context  we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind.  In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.

On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please.

When I make a table, it is clear after that what values are, but try to 'calculate' its values from your mind. I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what μ(n) means and shows. Simply as that.NEWLINE_TOKEN:(6) I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project. You correct me and I correct you if and only if I can. I am pretty tired of writting articles which envolve math, but I like math very much.

587384.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDavid, I have a couple of questions regarding your last edit to Skene's glands. Basically, the article matched the given references better before your edit. Did you work off of some other reference?  03:35 Jan 11, 2003 (UTC)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFeel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBy the way, your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN 23:32 Jan 14, 2003 (UTC)	2003	True	user	random	test

612650.0	NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor photographic lenses, I'd say go ahead and write an article at photographic lens and we'll just add links from lens and lens (disambiguation). I'm assuming that you'll want to write photographic lens from a more practical point of view, and keep lens mostly as a theory of optics type article. Alternately, we could just make lens a disambiguation page, and move the articles to lens (optics) and lens (photography). I don't have a strong preference, although the first option is easier.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for rainbow, I can't see anything wrong with the picture - what makes you think it is a fake?

615528.0	The pressure difference above and below the wing is less important to create lift than one might think. 90% percent of the lift comes from what is called 'downwash'. Simply a deflection of the airflow. Air is accelerated downwards. Lots of air! This requires a force and already Newton now that that creates an eqally but opposing force. If one looks at the force that the pressure difference creates for a small Cessna, it is only about 1500 N (approximately 300 pounds).	2003	False	article	random	train

No one who has heard of the father will not have heard of the son; no one who not heard of the father will be looking for his page (still nonexistent). We can always add a disambiguation page later if anyone complains.  (In that case, I think your suggestion of making it Nabokov is correct.)
